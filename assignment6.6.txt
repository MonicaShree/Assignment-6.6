1. Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler


 * In FIFO scheduling , a job tracker pulls job from a work queue . 

 * FIFO pulls the oldest job first . 

 * It is simple and efficient to implement .

 * In capacity scheduling several queues are created each with a configurable number of map and reduce slots .

 * Each queue is assigned a guaranteed capacity .

 * Queues are monitored in capacity schedulers . 

 *FIFO has no priority or size of job whereas in capacity scheduler when the queue doesnt consume its allocated capacity then the storage is temporarily given to other queues .

 * In FIFO the short jobs get stuck behind the long job , 

 * In Capacity scheduler , the jobs are organised into queues .




2. What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x

 * Hadoop 2.x has overcome the limitaions of hadoop 1.x by adding new architecture .

 * Hadoop 2.x has decoupled MapReduce components responsibilities into different components .

 * Hadoop 2.x has introduced YARN component for resource management .

 * Hadoop 1.x supports only one namespace for managing HDFS filesystem and hadoop 2.x has decoupled components responsibilities and it supports multiple namespace.

 * Hadoop 1.x uses fixed size slots for storage but hadoop 2.x has variable sized containers .

 * Hadoop 2.x has muti-tenancy whereas hadoop 1.x doesnt have it .

 * Hadoop 1.x supports only one programming model i.e, MapReduce .Hadoop 2.x supports multiple programming model with YARN compontents .

 * Hadoop 1.x has limitations in scalability whereas Hadoop 2.x has a proper scalability .
